            Uzbek food is meat-heavy, but there are dishes that everyone can
            love. The national Uzbek dish is plov, which is rice prepared with
            meat, onions and carrots.

            Many south-west regions in Uzbekistan, including Samarkand and
            Bukhara love to drink green tea because it can cool people down
            during hot temperatures. Many people drink their tea in pialas,
            which are small bowls, and they usually fill them up half-way
            because it makes the tea cool down faster.
