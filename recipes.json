      "Take your melted butter and spread evenly all throughout the dough",
      "Roll the dough up from bottom to top very closely, no air should be stuck in between",
      "Once it's long, stretch it a little more, but prevent it from ripping",
      "Cut 1-inch pieces and stick them in the fridge",
      "Repeat that process with the rest of the doughs",
      "Once the dough pieces from the fridge get a tad bit hard enough the butter doesn't melt, roll them out trying not to lose the flower circular lines within the middle until it's 2 cm thick",
      "Using your spoon, scoop out the meat onto the dough and close using all four sides making it into a square",
      "Place on the pan and finish with egg yolks on top for color and some sesame seeds, into the preheated oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit until the top and bottom become golden brown"
